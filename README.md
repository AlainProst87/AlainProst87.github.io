## Getting Started

### 1. Creating a GitHub Repository üõ†Ô∏è

Before cloning the repository, you need to create one on GitHub.

1. **Log in to GitHub**.
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
   - **Repository Name**: `yourusername.github.io` *(Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username)*
   - **Privacy**: Choose **Public**.
   - **Initialize with a README**: no.
3. **Create Repository**: Click **"Create repository"**.

### 2. Cloning the Repository üìÇ

Clone the `revealjs_cv` repository, which contains the template and necessary files for your CV website.

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/lundechen/revealjs_cv.git
cd revealjs_cv
```

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you just created:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*

### 3. Installing Live Server Extension üîå

To preview your website in real-time, install the Live Server extension in VSCode.

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Navigate to Extensions**: Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
3. **Search for "Live Server" or "Live Preview"**.
4. **Install the Extension**.

*Alternatively, use the command line:*

```bash
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

#### Using Live Server

- Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer sidebar.
- Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- **View in Browser**: A new browser tab will open, displaying your CV website. Any edits saved in VSCode will automatically refresh in the browser.

### 4. Setting Up Docker Compose üê≥

To streamline your development environment, use Docker Compose.

#### Adding `docker-compose.yml`

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project:

````yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  my-great-nginx-web-server:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html/
    restart: always
````

#### Running Docker Compose

Start your Docker container with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your CV website is now accessible at `http://localhost`.

## Version Control with Git üê±‚Äçüíª

Version control is crucial for tracking changes and collaborating efficiently. Git, combined with GitHub, offers a robust solution for managing your project.

### 1. Initializing Git

If you haven't already initialized Git in your project, follow these steps.

```bash
git init
```

This command initializes an empty Git repository in your project directory.

*Verify the initialization:*

```bash
git status
```

You should see the untracked files listed.

### 2. Committing Changes üìù

Start tracking your project files and commit your initial setup.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup revealjs_cv template"
```

- **`git add .`**: Stages all files in the current directory.
- **`git commit -m "..."`**: Commits the staged files with a descriptive message.

### 3. Pushing to GitHub üöÄ

To host your repository on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, follow these steps.

#### Linking Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*

> **Note:** Using SSH URLs (`git@github.com:...`) enables passwordless authentication once SSH keys are set up.

#### Pushing Your Code

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

- **`-u`**: Sets the upstream branch.
- **`origin`**: The remote repository.
- **`main`**: The branch name.

*If `main` branch doesn't exist yet, you might need to push to `master` or your default branch.*

## Setting Up GitHub Pages üåê

GitHub Pages allows you to host your website directly from your GitHub repository. Follow these steps to deploy your CV website.

### 1. Configuring GitHub Pages

1. **Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub**.
2. **Access Settings**:
   - Click on the **"Settings"** tab.
3. **Select GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**.
4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under **"Source"**, select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`).
   - Choose the root folder (`/`) if your `index.html` is in the root directory.
5. **Save**:
   - Click **"Save"** to apply the settings.

> **Note:** Deployment may take a few minutes. Once done, GitHub Pages will provide a URL to access your website.

*Example URL:*

```
https://yourusername.github.io/
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*

## Advanced Deployment with Docker Compose üê≥

For those interested in deploying their CV website on a cloud VM using Docker Compose, follow these advanced steps.

### 1. Dockerizing Your Application

Docker allows you to containerize your application, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### Using `docker-compose.yml`

Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` is set up as shown:

````yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  my-great-nginx-web-server:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html/
    restart: always
````

#### Building and Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **`-d`**: Runs the containers in detached mode.

*Your CV website is now accessible at `http://localhost`.*

### 2. Deploying to a Cloud VM ‚òÅÔ∏è

Deploy your Dockerized application to a cloud service provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

#### Steps Overview

1. **Provision a VM Instance**: Choose your preferred cloud provider and create a new virtual machine.
2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure both are installed on your VM.
3. **Transfer Your Project Files**: Use `scp` or Git to transfer your project to the VM.
4. **Build and Run Docker Containers**: Execute the same Docker Compose commands on the VM.
5. **Configure Firewall and DNS**: Open necessary ports and (optionally) configure a custom domain.

*Refer to your cloud provider's documentation for detailed instructions.*

## Best Practices and Tips üí°

- **Commit Often**: Regular commits help track progress and make it easier to revert changes if needed.
- **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Clear messages improve project documentation and collaboration.
- **Use Branches**: For significant changes or new features, create separate branches to maintain the stability of the main branch.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/custom-theme
  ```
