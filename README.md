2. **Modify `index.html`**:
   
   ```html:dist/reveal.css
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
   <head>
       ...
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/theme/black.css">
       ...
   </head>
   ...
   </html>
   ```

   *Change `black.css` to your desired theme, such as `white.css` or any other available theme.*

> **Explore Themes:** Visit the [Reveal.js Themes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/css/theme) repository to view all available themes.

#### Custom CSS

Create a `custom.css` file to override default styles.

```css:css/custom.css
/* Example: Change the background color of slides */
.reveal section {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

/* Example: Customize fonts */
.reveal {
    font-family: 'Arial, sans-serif';
}
```

*Include the custom stylesheet in `index.html`:*

```html:index.html
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/custom.css">
    ...
</head>
```

#### Modifying Slide Styles

Adjust slide-specific styles using CSS selectors.

```css:css/custom.css
/* Center-align all headings */
.reveal h1, .reveal h2, .reveal h3 {
    text-align: center;
}

/* Add spacing between list items */
.reveal ul li {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

### 2. Adding Interactive Elements

Enhance user engagement by incorporating interactive components such as transitions, animations, and embedded media.

#### Slide Transitions

Reveal.js supports various slide transition effects.

*Configure transitions in `index.html`:*

```js:index.html
<script>
    Reveal.initialize({
        // ... other configurations
        transition: 'fade', // Choose from 'none', 'slide', 'fade', 'convex', 'concave', 'zoom'
    });
</script>
```

*Example: Using 'zoom' transition.*

```js:index.html
<script>
    Reveal.initialize({
        // ... other configurations

   *Add Mermaid script in `index.html`:*

   ```html:index.html
   <head>
       ...
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
       ...
   </head>
   ```

2. **Initialize Mermaid**:

   ```js:index.html
   <script>
       mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
   </script>
   ```

3. **Add Diagrams in Slides**:

## Advanced Deployment with Docker

For those interested in deploying their CV website on a cloud VM using Docker, follow these advanced steps.

### 1. Dockerizing Your Application

Docker allows you to containerize your application, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### Understanding the `Dockerfile`

A `Dockerfile` contains instructions to build your Docker image.

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

- **`FROM nginx:latest`**: Uses the latest Nginx image as the base.
- **`COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/`**: Copies all project files to Nginx's default HTML directory.

#### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t revealjs_cv .
```

- **`-t revealjs_cv`**: Tags the image with the name `revealjs_cv`.
- **`.`**: Specifies the current directory as the build context.

#### Running the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 revealjs_cv
```

- **`-d`**: Runs the container in detached mode.
- **`-p 80:80`**: Maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.

*Your CV website is now accessible at `http://localhost`.*

### 2. Deploying to a Cloud VM

Deploy your Dockerized application to a cloud service provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

#### Steps Overview

1. **Provision a VM Instance**: Choose your preferred cloud provider and create a new virtual machine.
2. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your VM.
3. **Transfer Your Project Files**: Use `scp` or Git to transfer your project to the VM.
4. **Build and Run Docker Container**: Execute the same Docker commands as above on the VM.
5. **Configure Firewall and DNS**: Open necessary ports and (optionally) configure a custom domain.

*Refer to your cloud provider's documentation for detailed instructions.*

## Setting Up SSH for GitHub

Establishing SSH authentication allows you to interact with GitHub repositories securely without entering your password repeatedly.

### 1. Generating SSH Keys

Generate a new SSH key pair on your local machine.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- **`-t ed25519`**: Specifies the SSH key type.
- **`-C "..."`**: Adds a comment/email for identification.

*When prompted:*

- **File Location**: Press `Enter` to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- **Passphrase**: Enter a secure passphrase or leave blank for no passphrase.

*Example:*

```bash
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
```

#### Viewing Your SSH Public Key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

*Output:*

```plaintext
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your_email@example.com
```

### 2. Adding SSH Key to GitHub

1. **Copy the SSH Key**:

   ```bash
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # macOS
   xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Linux
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Windows (Git Bash)
   ```

2. **Navigate to GitHub**:
   - Click on your profile picture and select **"Settings"**.

3. **Access SSH and GPG Keys**:
   - In the left sidebar, click **"SSH and GPG keys"**.

4. **Add New SSH Key**:
   - Click **"New SSH key"**.
   - **Title**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "My Laptop SSH Key").
   - **Key**: Paste the copied SSH key.
5. **Save**: Click **"Add SSH key"** and confirm with your GitHub password if prompted.

> **Security Tip:** Keep your private SSH key (`id_ed25519`) secure and never share it.
